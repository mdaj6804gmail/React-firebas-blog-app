      "Creating a powerful data visualization story: The winner of the Global Partnership-World Bank Data Viz Contest",
    discription:
      "Data visualizations do more than display numbers; good data visualizations tell a story not only to educate, but also to engage and inspire their audiences. Data is crucial for informing knowledge work and measuring the impact of sustainable development programs. The Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data and the World Bank's Development Data Group often tell stories with data, and the two organizations wanted to see what data storytellers worldwide could do with development data.  The Global Partnership held a data visualization contest, supported by the World Bank, in September for anyone interested in displaying data from the World Bank or other government data sets to create an interesting story. The challenge was to tell a data visualization story that showed the interconnectedness of Sustainable Development Goals and revealed how the mobilization of different resources could be linked to impact.  Many data enthusiasts rose to the challenge, with submissions from 34 countries and six continents using health, climate, or other data sets to tell a story. A panel of judges narrowed the entries down to three finalists that tackle the impact of climate change, gender inequality, and armed conflict through the power of data stories and visualizations. Today, Miguel Ángel Dobrich and Gabriel Farías from Amenaza Roboto, a science and technology news website based in Montevideo, Uruguay, were announced as the winners of the data visualization contest at the prestigious Festival de Datos (held in Uruguay on November 7-9). Their entry, “From Drought to Floods: The Impact on Labor in the Coastal Zones of Uruguay, from East to West,” uses data to show how climate change is reshaping workers’ lives across Uruguay, examining the impact on three localities in Uruguay. The data stories describe the impact of changing weather patterns on an established shrimp fishery in Valizas and showcase the effects of flooding risks on the mobility of workers in Montevideo and the potential displacement of many people living in Ciudad del Plata.

    title: "Updated estimates of the Prosperity Gap",
    discription:
      "In 2019, around 80% of the world lived on less than $25 per day, which is around the value of the typical poverty line of high-income countries. $25 per day is also very close to the income or consumption of a typical person living in a country that moves from middle income to high income status. The Prosperity Gap is a new measure that helps us track how far the world, or any society, is from the $25 per day income threshold. It can be used to measure the World Bank’s goal of promoting shared prosperity. Formally, the Prosperity Gap is the average factor by which individuals’ incomes must be multiplied to attain a prosperity standard of $25 per day for all. Over the same time, global average per capita income improved by 35% compared to the 54% improvement in the Prosperity Gap. The larger improvement in the Prosperity Gap reflects the larger improvement in incomes of those at the bottom compared to those at the top of the world income distribution, largely driven by rapid growth in large developing countries such as China and India. In other words, the Prosperity Gap captures not just the improvement in the global mean, but also the sharp reduction in global interpersonal income inequality over this period.",
